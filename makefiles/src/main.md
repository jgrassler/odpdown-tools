# Second section of my presentation

## One Slide

* This is a slide.

* It contains bullet points.

  * Which can of course be nested

## One Slide

The snippet of Markdown text in this comment will appear in
the transcript as-is. You can either duplicate the slides
bullet points here or not. That is entirely up to you.

Since these markdown snippets will be concatenated together
to form the transcript, they should contain properly spelled
out text going into a lot more detail than the bare bullet
points on the slide. Basically you can write a speech to go
with your slides as you write them. Alternatively, you can
write just a bunch of terse speaker's notes to print and put
on a lectern. It is entirely up to you.

## Another Slide

* This is another slide.

* It contains bullet points as well.

  * Which can of course be nested

<!--

## One Slide

The snippet of Markdown text in this comment will also appear
in the transcript as-is, just like the previous one.
